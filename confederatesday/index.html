            <p> <span class="dateline"> GRAHAM, N.C. — </span>At the intersection of Main and Elm streets, the words “Our Confederate Soldiers” are inscribed at the base of a 30-foot-high monument.</p>
            
            <p>Standing at the top of the monument in front of Alamance County’s Historic Courthouse, with a rifle in hand, is a statue of a Confederate common soldier.</p>
                
            <p>The statue is dedicated to more than 1,000 men from Alamance County who died fighting for the Confederacy.</p>

            <p>Whether the intentions of the statue were to honor the dead or idolize their cause, it has led to controversy within the almost 15,000 person community.</p>

            <p>The roots of the controversy trace back to May 20, 1861, the day North Carolina seceded from the Union at the outset of the Civil War. Despite the passing of over 150 years, the date continues to cause conflict.</p>

            <p>A year ago, in honor of the recognized state holiday, Confederate’s Day, Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC), <br> <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/neo-confederate" target="_blank"> a listed hate group,</a> hosted a rally at the base of the statue.</p>

            <p>This event brought attention from across the nation to the streets of Graham. On May 20, another organization is trying to bring that same attention back to the city, but for a different reason.</p>
                            
            <p class="subhead">Loving Graham</p>
               
            <p>The “Love Graham Sidewalk Festival” will be taking place from May 19-20. Instead of Confederate banners and battle flags, the city's streets will be packed with art, music, beer and puppies.</p>

            <p>The event is being planned by <a href="http://www.thecooperative.co/" target="_blank"> Co|Operative,</a> a grassroots organization focused on community development.</p>

            <p>The festival is the brainchild of Chelsea Dickey, the director of community development at Co|Operative. With the help of Audrey Garton, the founder of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamnorthcarolina/?hc_ref=ARTVOOwH6zIKmddlCbp3oARi9y24enGbS_Kh96Dtiw3aA8cwXgO0ckBsDWi7y8T1wsE" target="_blank"> Independent Artist Movement (IAM)</a>, the two organizations were able to plan the entire event.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1595839493867230/" target="_blank">the event page on Facebook,</a> the purpose of the festival is to celebrate Graham’s downtown and to bring the entire community together.</p>

            <p>In order to host the event, Dickey and Garton presented the idea to the Graham City Council, who later voted 5-0 in favor of their request.</p>

            <p>“We wanted to do something with a spring festival and show off our downtown,” Dickey said. “There are seven businesses coming in the next few months to downtown Graham, so [the festival] will also help promote the revitalization we are going through.”</p>

            <p>To help with the festival’s attendance, Dickey says the event’s dates were chosen to coincide with Elon University’s graduation ceremony.</p>
 
            <p>Elon junior Blaine Williamson has been working as the communications coordinator at Co|Operative for the last two years. She has played a significant role in organizing the art festival, but not as much of a role as Co|Operative has had on her college experience.</p>

            <p>“Being an Elon student, we definitely have a built-in brand and when I started really getting invested in Graham, I realized we didn’t have something like that,” Blaine said. “Having a pride of place is really important and something I’ve been learning a lot about.”</p>

            <p>The media analytics major took her passion for Graham and organized the creation of the city’s first slogan and logo.</p>

            <p>With a $4,000 grant from <a href="http://www.impactalamance.com/apply-for-funding/grant-opportunities/" target="_blank"> the Impact Alamance Community Innovation Fund </a> and nearly three months of work, Blaine helped develop the “Love Graham” logo.</p>

            <p>“We wanted to incite two different messages,” Blaine said. “‘Love Graham,’ do that and be a part of this community, and ‘Love, Graham,’ like you are signing off a letter and Graham loves you back.”</p>

            <p>Co|Operative and the IAM plan to paint Blaine’s slogan on a mural during the festival. The mural will include several different elements with deeper meanings.</p>

            <p>Molly Feudale, one of the artists in charge of the mural, cannot wait to see her work come to life.</p>

            <p>“The original concept of the mural was to make something that is positive and colorful and shows the love we have for our community,” Feudale said. “That’s why we wanted to incorporate a mural with the Love Graham Art Festival.”</p>

            <p class="subhead">The Confederate Controversy</p>
                 
            <p>Visitors will be enjoying the festival’s events in the shadow cast by the Confederate statue in front of the courthouse. The statue has been the site of several events in the last few years.</p>

            <p>“In the past there were a couple of demonstrations this weekend,” Dickey said. “We figured if we could have an art event and have a positive experience in downtown Graham and have it welcome to everyone, it would be more of a Graham we would claim.”</p>

            <p>Dickey is referring to the ACTBAC rally hosted at the statue a year ago.</p>

            <p>Despite the rally’s approval from the Graham City Council and a heavy police presence, counter-protesters flocked to the base of the statue, which led to five arrests.</p>

            <p>But Confederate common soldier statues and the controversies they cause are not unique to Graham.</p>

            <p>Statues such as the one in Graham reside in 48 of the 100 counties in North Carolina. Throughout the state, there are 53 of these statues standing.</p>

            <p>But following the Aug. 11, 2017, “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the deadly counter-protests, North Carolina has experienced several protests over the standing of these statues.</p>

            <p>One protest in Durham County on Aug. 14, 2017, led to the toppling of the county’s statue. Similarly to Graham’s, the statue was located at the front of the county’s historic courthouse.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The threat of a similar confrontation or a retaliation protest from ACTBAC is what led Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson to request the Graham City Council to withdraw its approval for the art festival.</p>
            
            <p>While Graham has jurisdiction over its streets, the city shares jurisdiction over the courthouse grounds with Johnson and his officers.</p>
                
            <p>But Johnson’s requests have been denied, and his concern seems to be unfounded.</p>
            
        
            <p>Gary Williamson, the founder and president of ACTBAC, says he has no idea why his organization is being included in discussions concerning the festival.</p>

            <p>Williamson attributes the fear of his organization retaliating to the twist news organizations such as the Burlington-Times have put in <a href="http://www.thetimesnews.com/news/20180405/on-actbac-rallys-anniversary-art-weekend" target="_blank">their articles.</a></p>
            
            <p>“The only reason this is an issue is because the Times-News made it an issue,” Williamson said. “I had no clue it was an attack against us until Alamance News and the Times-News stirred the pot. It has nothing to do with us. They have every right to be there and I hope they have a good event.”</p>

            <p>ACTBAC’s Confederate Day celebration has been moved to May 10, 2018, the day Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States, was captured by the Union.</p>

            <p>With the event now being moved, Jerry Peterman, mayor of Graham, hopes those choosing to celebrate Confederate Day will take time to visit the festival.</p>


            <p>“Come and see what we are doing in downtown Graham,” Peterman said. “It is a festival to celebrate art, not that statue, or its removal … anyone that wants to be here and have a good time, please come down to Graham.”</p>

            <p>Despite the controversy that Williamson credits to news outlets, this is exactly what he plans to do.</p>

            <p>“I plan on going to see what it's all about,” Williamson said. “I plan on taking my kids.”</p>

            <p>Williamson and his children will be able to enjoy the many artists the IAM is bringing together for the art festival.</p>

            <p>Curry Wilkinson just moved into Burlington a few months ago, but has already built his reputation as the area's only contemporary wood-fire potter.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m kind of new to the whole operation here,” Wilkinson said. “Since just coming back into the Burlington-Graham area, I want to find my niche in the community.”</p>

            <p>As one of the featured artists at the festival, Wilkinson can’t wait to show the community the art he's been working on.</p>

            <p>In addition to teaching pottery classes, Wilkinson has been spending most of his time building his own wood-fire kiln in his backyard.</p>

            <p>The kiln Wilkinson is building is expected to be 23 feet long and 7 feet tall. When built, it will be Alamance County’s first wood-fire kiln.</p>
        
            <p>But the construction of his kiln has taken a pause as Wilkinson has been focused on preparing for the festival. He wants his art to play a part in bringing the community together.</p>
