											<h3>A local perspective</h3>
								
										</header>
										<div class="content">

   <p>In the heart of North Carolina resides Elon University: a beautiful, growing, and well-to-do private school neighboring the city of Burlington.</p>

	<p>But drive about five miles east, and you will find a completely different atmosphere.</p>

	<p>You’ll find a city and county that suffers from a poverty rate of 18.9 percent, as of this year. The amount of children living in poverty is just above the North Carolina state average, while 42 percent of Alamance County residents are considered "low-earning."</p>

	<p>Frankie Maness, city manager for the city of Graham, said homelessness is definitely present and is an ongoing concern; the city often receives complaints about panhandlers.</p>
	
	

	<p>"My suspicion and observation is that homelessness is present in our community and considering our income levels, many may be a paycheck or two away from homelessness," Maness said.</p>

	<p>However, Maness said that he does not feel it is a plaguing issue, "It hasn’t presented itself as a major problem directly related to city services, but we are aware of isolated cases in the community," Maness said. "In the most recent case that presented itself, we attempted to find the individual the appropriate social services."</p>

	<p>Richard Gary, director of Allied Churches in Burlington, wants to help make a change and combat the city of Burlington’s homelessness problem. Allied Churches provides the greater Alamance County community with an emergency homeless shelter and is the "only center for those in a housing crisis" in the region, according to its official website.</p>

	<p>Gary’s roots stem from being homeless himself, and it is another reason why he wants to decrease the current homeless rate in Burlington. Gary said he wants to see the local government step in and create programs that helped him growing up as a homeless youth. Although it is not that simple, Gary said, it is a necessary measure, given the number of homeless people that turn to crime as a result of having nowhere to go.</p>

											<h3>By the numbers</h3>
								
										</header>
										<div class="content">
									<p>According to the 2015 Alamance County Community Assessment, the most recently released report, "27 percent of all children living in Alamance County lived below the poverty line. This is greater than the North Carolina average of 25 percent of children living in poverty, however it is less than in 2014 when 29 percent of Alamance County children lived in poverty."</p>

<p>While those statistics seem stark, the population of homeless is not as staggering. From a 2014 point-in-time count from North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness (NCCEH), Alamance County had 134 homeless people, .09 percent of the population, in comparison to neighboring counties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Guilford County had 897 homeless (.18 percent of the population)</li>
<li>Orange County had 108 homeless (.08 percent of the population)</li>
<li>Caswell County had 24 homeless (.1 percent of the population)</li>
<li>And Chatham County had 28 homeless (.04 percent of the population).</li>
</ul>

	<span class="image fit"><a href="map.jpg"><img src="map.jpg"></a></span>

<p>That does not mean the problem should be ignored. There are certain ordinances and laws that are hindering homeless populations, however big or small, from getting back on their feet. In some cities in North Carolina, such as Chapel Hill, there are ordinances against sleeping in public places, loitering and panhandling or begging, according to The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty's report in 2014.</p>

<p>According to the city ordinances in the city of Graham, it is unlawful to solicit, peddle or beg in parks. It is also not legal to "offer a cup or other receptacle for the deposit of money or [collect] in connection with the playing of any musical instrument on the streets or other public places without having a permit…," or "stand in the streets attempting to solicit any employment, business, or contributions from the driver or occupants of any vehicle." Loitering on the streets is also unlawful. If a police officer sees a loiterer on the streets, he must warn them of the possibility of their arrest.</p>

									<p>Allied Churches receives nine percent of its funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD. The nine percent includes $25,000 for administrative expenses, or what Gary calls "paying the bills."</p>



<p>According to April Durr, director of community impact for United Way of Alamance County, United Way offers opportunities for grant funding each year within the community. Currently, Allied Churches is receiving a one-year grant from United Way in the amount of $80,000, paid out monthly. The rest of the grant is used to house those who are homeless at the Allied Churches shelter. Allied Churches receives most of its funds from donations; according to their 990 form from 2016, the organization received a total of $1,616,847 in contributions.</p>

<p>This past year, Alamance County became part of a five-county region, known as PRACC; making up this region are Rockingham, Pearson, Caswell, Chatham and Alamance County. The creation of this regional committee was to help combat the poverty and housing crisis within the PRACC Region, as about 8200 residents are currently homeless.</p>

<p>According to Jai Baker, Allied Churches housing director, PRACC will affect Alamance County grants, as the county is now anticipating "influx from four other counties," as Alamance is the only county with a homeless shelter. In an Alamance Housing Committee meeting on December 7, Baker said that it is estimated there will be another 100-150 people, including families, in the Allied Churches shelter.</p>

<p>"We receive a total funding of $56,000 annually towards shelter operations," Gary said. "The average staff salary is about $35,000, the light bill is $20,000 annually, so if that gives you an idea, it’s already gone."</p>

<p>Gary said that he’s had to cut five positions already just to make ends meet within the organization.</p>

<p>Allied Churches was denied a request of $100,000 from the county commissioner. In comparison, Mecklenberg County received $500,000, Guilford County received $700,000, and Durham received $100,000 in grant money from the government for homelessness assistance programs.</p>

<p>Based on Gary’s assertion, Alamance County ranks well below the average in its request for assistance.</p>

<p>Sonye Randolph, community development outreach coordinator for the city of Burlington, said that the city itself offers more technical assistance to programs such as Allied Churches. However, assistance is through the Burlington Housing Authority; Randolph said that their coordination with these programs revolves around giving "referral sources."</p>

<p>"This year what I did differently was count residential treatment services; it helps people to detox," Randolph said. "We do more facility assistance. We help to make things like their bathrooms healthier and handicapped accessible."</p>

<p>In the streets of Burlington, government officials are looking to help those who need assistance.</p>

<p>Chris Verdeck, assistant police chief of Burlington, said that his department does "whatever it takes" to help those who need it, unless they are a direct threat to citizens.</p>

<p>In 2014, 100 cities across the United States banned sitting or laying down in public places, while in 18 cities in the nation, it is illegal to sleep in public. Verdeck said that in Burlington, the police do not pressure people to move if they are sleeping or sitting on the street.</p>

<p>"We have got a top-notch shelter here and we try to refer those folks the best we can to that shelter when it’s available," Verdeck said. "It makes it a bit more difficult when they’ve had encounters in the past with folks at the shelter and they’re not allowed to go back there. But we do try to get them the help that they need."</p>

<p>According to Verdeck, the police force has a good relationship with shelters such as Allied Churches.</p>

<p>While Verdeck could not answer to crime specifically, many homeless people who are jailed have been sentenced for offenses that pertain to Richard Gary’s assessment of "entering the system."</p>

<blockquote>"We have got a top-notch shelter here and we try to refer those folks the best we can to that shelter when it’s available. It makes it a bit more difficult when they’ve had encounters in the past with folks at the shelter and they’re not allowed to go back there. But we do try to get them the help that they need."<div style="text-align:right;">— Chris Verdeck, assistant police chief of Burlington</div></blockquote>

<p>This concept of "getting in the system and not being able to get out" is what causes many people who are homeless to remain in their current state.</p>

<p>"When you get out of jail, you’re limited in finding a job," Gary said. " If you have a misdemeanor, people don’t want to say that you’re barred from employment, but you are. So you come out and find a job, you reenter the system. You do the same thing you did to enter the system."</p>

<p>While homelessness in the county is slowly getting better, shelters such as Allied Churches are still struggling to make ends meet to provide for a community at need. While the area is by no means in crisis, there are still those struggling and the local government is taking steps to help those in need get back on their feet.</p>
