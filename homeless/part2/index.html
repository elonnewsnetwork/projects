   <p>AT SIX IN THE MORNING, in a cramped room filled with identical bunk beds, Courtney Cummings wakes up to the smiling faces of her two daughters cuddling up to her. She helps them get dressed, makes sure they have their homework completed and packed up in their "Frozen" themed backpacks, eats breakfast with them and sends them off to school.</p>



	<p>This is a common routine for many single mothers around the world, but for Cummings it's a little different.</p>

    <p>Cummings, 36, and her two youngest children, six-year-old Rhaniya and two-year-old Jaziah, are living at Allied Churches of Alamance County (ACAC), the only homeless shelter in the county located on the outskirts of downtown Burlington.</p>

	<p>Allied Church's mission is to prevent and end homelessness and food insecurity in Alamance County. The shelter is open 24-hours a day, seven-days a week providing an array of services including food, clothing and a temporary home for those who have no place to stay.</p>
	
	<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ncceh.org/media/files/page/444c39d2/2013_nc_statewide_pit.pdf">North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness,</a> 0.19 percent of the national population is homeless while 0.12 percent of North Carolina's population is. In comparison, 0.09 percent of Alamance County's population is living without a home.</p>

	<p>Cummings and her daughters are part of that 0.09 percent. She says that if it was not for the shelter, she would be lost.</p>
                                            
    <p>"I have no where to go," she said. "I don't have a roof over my head. If I got put out of here, I don't know what I'd do."</p>

	<p>Cummings does have some family support at the shelter, though. Rhaniya and Jaziah’s aunt, Saslee Taborn and her children are currently living at Allied Churches as well.</p>

	<p>At 28-years-old, Taborn has five children whose ages range from one-month to nine-years-old. But even during this difficult time, without a home or a job, she is straightforward with them about their situation.</p>

   <p>Taborn has had several jobs over the years, but because of maternity leave and taking care of her children, she says it is hard to keep a job, which adds to the weight of the situation.</p>

<p>“It only gets stressful when I’m not working,” she said. “Because, I know I need things done and me knowing that I can’t give them [the children] things that they need. It stresses me out. But I always keep a strong mindset and tell them that things are gonna be OK. I’m gonna take care of them. I’m gonna do what I have to do.”</p>

<p>Even though she does not like the term, Taborn is willing to admit that she is homeless. But she says that this label is not going to keep her from working hard to improve their quality of life and create a bright, stable future.</p>

<p>“You never wanna say that you’re homeless," she said. "But you can’t be ashamed because here, they help you out and they get you on your feet and they put you where you need to be. It’s just up to you if you want to keep moving forward.”</p>
                                            
<span class="image right"><img src="photo8.jpg"><br><em>Richard Gary, executive director of Allied Churches of Alamance County, talks about his personal experience with homelessness and ACAC's goals and mission.</em></span> 

<p>Richard Gary, the executive director of ACAC, says their mission is just that. Although they provide resources to assist their residents, they expect them to take responsibility for themselves and use them to move forward.</p>

<p>"It's my overall goal as executive director to have people get on this train with me and have the same level of passion, same level of success and just the same willingness and drive to help people," he said. "To give a hand up not a hand out."</p>    
                                            
                                           
 <p>For the past 20 years, Gary has been working with homeless individuals. But before he was helping them, he was one of them.</p>

<p>“Everything I’ve done during my professional career is just pretty much a reflection of what happened to me during my childhood,” said Gary. “I actually was a homeless youth growing up and so a lot of the services that Allied Churches provide to the community, as a youth I actually utilized a lot of those services in different capacities.”</p>

<p>Cummings and her family are now utilizing the services that Gary and his team are providing at the shelter.</p>

<p>Cummings is sitting on the floor, among the clutter of her belongings, unpacking and trying to envision her new life in her own apartment. Although still unemployed, she is keeping a positive outlook and her head high.</p>

<p>"After I get myself situated and stable, I'm going to find a job and get my kids situated," she said. "Get them their beds, and all of their stuff, get them situated."  </p>
