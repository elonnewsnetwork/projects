<p>When Dwayne Daughtry meets someone for the first time, it rarely starts with an introduction.</p>
    
<p>"Every day I feel like I'm reliving my crime all over again because when people talk to me, the first thing they want to hear about is what I did. Not what I do, or who I am," Daughtry said. </p>
    
<p>In June 2011, Daughtry was charged with sexual battery and said he became known as 021152S11, his Sex Registration Number. Daughtry said his placement on <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://sexoffender.ncsbi.gov/search.aspx" target = _blank>North Carolina's Sex Offender Registry</a> has defined him every day since.</p>
    
<p>Daughtry and more than 25,500 other people are listed on the state's registry.</p>

<p>"Before all this happened, I was pro-registry because I just didn't know any facts about it," Daughtry said. "Then I became a part of this group and learned quickly there were no resources, no advocacy, no other side of the coin."</p>
    
<p>Eight-and-a-half years after registration, Daughtry now works as the executive director of <a style=font-weight:bold href ="https://ncrsol.org/" target = _blank>North Carolina's affiliate</a> of the <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://narsol.org/" target = _blank>National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws</a>.</p>
    
<p>"We're the most hated group in North Carolina," Daughtry said. "People hate the crime and so they hate the people on the other side of it as well."</p>

             <iframe title="Sexual offenders in North Carolina" aria-label="USA north carolina counties choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-4XHTc" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4XHTc/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
        
<p>Alamance County is home to 394 registrants. It has the ninth highest number of sex offenders in North Carolina, the statewide county average being approximately 187.</p>
    
<p>Every day Lt. Bray McAteer has one of the county's registrants come into his office, shake his hand and ask for help. As the deputy in charge of the Sheriff’s Office’s Special Victims Unit, McAteer and his eight-person team monitor all registered offenders in the community.</p>

<p>Across the country, law enforcement is federally required to make the personal information of sex offenders — names, races, sex, heights, weights, eye and hair colors, addresses, birthdays, scars, marks and tattoos — publicly available. The statute that orders this, nicknamed <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.meganslaw.com/" target =_blank>Megan's Law</a>, was passed in an effort to limit the contact offenders have with vulnerable populations.</p>
    
<p>Research has found, however, that the same laws meant to safeguard the public limit the possibilities of registrants, thus increasing the chances of recidivism — the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend.</p>

<p>“You’ve got people on the registry that are predators, true predators. But you also have guys that are 18 or 19 years old — a senior in high school who slept with a freshman — and they have to deal with the exact same things as a pedophile or a rapist,” McAteer said. “I’ve been doing the sex offender registry for four years now, and to be honest there’s not a lot out there for them.”</p>

<p>Without state or federal help, low-risk sex offenders in Alamance are left to rely on themselves and local non-governmental organizations for support.</p>

        <h2><strong>Right after registration</strong></h2>

<p>After registration or during parole — approximately 5% of Alamance's offenders are in jail — most registrants are required to take classes focused on reducing recidivism.</p>

                <span class="image right"><div><img src="images/mcateer_2.jpg" alt="Richard Miller lectures about the  where concealed carry permit may not be valid on Sept. 14, 2019. Photo by Anton L. Delgado | Elon News Network." /><i>Lt. Bray McAteer, the deputy in charge of Alamance County's Special Victims Unit, inputs the name of the newest sexual offender living in the county into the state registry on Wednesday, Dec. 11. When approved, this addition will bring Alamance's total number of registrants to 395.</i></div></span>        
        
<p>According to McAteer, these classes aren't offered in Alamance. He can't remember the last time they were. To comply with court orders or parole, offenders must travel to other counties, such as Lexington, Greensboro, Durham or Reidsville.</p>

<p>Ed Dawson, a clinical psychologist with <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.manta.com/c/mt8fgtw/engaging-life-psychological" target = _blank >Engaging Life Psychological Services</a> in Lexington, has been teaching one of these classes since 1990. He is currently working with approximately 35 sex offenders.</p>

<p>“These classes help offenders learn about the circumstances that led to them engaging in these illegal activities. Through group sessions they learn the importance of decision making and how to avoid decisions that could lead them to harm others,” Dawson said. “There is a lot of focus on victims and while that’s absolutely needed, prevention needs to start with the offenders.”</p>

<p>In most cases, classes are an hour long and take place once a week, four times a month. To pass Dawson’s course, offenders must attend approximately 80 sessions. According to Dawson, the biggest hindrance that keeps registrants from this goal is lack of finances.</p>

<p>Despite these classes being court-mandated the state doesn’t financially support any of the offenders in Dawson’s class. He said on occasion the federal government financially supports offenders. But in the last two years, he has only taught three registrants in this position.</p>

<p>“I am in favor of them having a little skin in the game because it makes them value the treatment more because they are the ones paying for it,” Dawson said. “But if the state could supplement the people financially struggling, it would allow the offender to focus on the treatment rather than the payment.”</p>

<p>Dawson’s program costs $160 a month. He estimates close to 70% of the offenders in his class struggle with financial compliance throughout the course.</p>
    
<p>According to Daughtry, this is an issue NCRSOL faces with most of its clients.</p>
    
<p>"The reason people don't complete the classes is because they can't afford it. Then they're considered within violation of the court order requiring the class, so it creates a false recidivism. It's not recidivism based upon a committed crime," Daughtry said. "They couldn't afford a class that should have been free."</p>
    
            <iframe title="Comparing sexual and recidivist offenders" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-DkKal" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DkKal/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="474"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
    
<p>McAteer, Dawson and Daughtry all agree that housing and unemployment are the main reasons offenders struggle financially.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Homeless, unemployed and ostracized</strong></h2>
    
<p>Once on the registry, offenders must stay certain distances from “protected locations,” such as schools, daycares, nurseries, playgrounds and children’s museums, at all times.</p>

<p>McAteer works with Alamance's <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.alamance-nc.com/newgis/" target=_blank >Geographic Information Systems Department</a> to map out the distance offenders must keep from these locations.</p> 
    
<p>Marlena Islay, the director of the department, declined to share the protected locations in the county. But she did confirm that there are five sites in the town of Elon, which is home to 12 registrants.</p>

<p>These restrictions are most scrutinized when offenders are looking for housing. Before moving, they must check their potential address with the Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>“I’ve had folks check five, six, seven or even eight addresses before they find one that works. A lot of the addresses that I end up checking are in bad neighborhoods because they can’t get good jobs,” McAteer said. “I mean they did do the crime, but still, sometimes you’re like, ‘Dang, they can’t seem to catch a break.'”</p>

                <div class=".video-small" style="padding-right: 25px; float:left;">
                <iframe width="426" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/22tRKqJrx40" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Twice a year, McAteer’s and his unit visit the address of every sex offender in the county.</p> 
    
<p>Last August, the SVU visited the homes of 356 offenders. <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6574112-Sex-Offender-Registration.html" target=_blank>Bright pink notes</a> were left on the door handles of unattended homes and nine registrants were charged with housing noncompliance, meaning they didn't properly register their address or were living too close to a protected location. While McAteer respects the importance of these limitations when dealing with high-risk offenders, he sees a direct correlation between the housing challenges low-risk offenders face and their success in society after registration.</p>

<p>“There are some folks that come into my office that just have nowhere else to go. I’ve got 15 to 18 offenders struggling with homelessness,” McAteer said. “But I still got to have a place where I can go see you. Whether it’s a bush, a tree or a sign.”</p>

<p>The state registry lists 268 offenders as homeless, 10 of them being in Alamance.</p>
    
<p>The ripple effect of registration also directly influences the job prospects of offenders. McAteer said close to 80% of the offenders in Alamance struggle to find a stable job.</p>

<p>“If you do a background check on someone and they are an offender, it’s not a surprise that most people don’t want to work with you,” McAteer said.</p>

<p> A <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6568698-Post-Release-Recidivism-and-Employment-among.html" target = _blank>2014 study</a> published by the International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences found that 36.3% of sex offenders "were never employed since release from prison," raising the recidivism rate among those registrants to 54.7%.</p>

<p>According to Barry University professor Jill Levenson, who studies the effectiveness of social policies designed to reduce sexual violence, the instability caused by the public registry is also a risk to the community.</p>

<p>“Our laws undermine the essential factors that help people succeed in living a law-abiding life. … It’s not just a name on a list. It is an eternally limiting factor for a person that is trying to live life just like everyone else,” Levenson said. “That doesn’t make a lot of sense for high-risk offenders and it can actually increase recidivism in low-risk offenders.”</p>
    
<p>Collectively, Alamance’s offenders have been charged with over 605 offenses.</p>

               <iframe title="Sexual offenses in Alamance County" aria-label="Interactive pie chart" id="datawrapper-chart-71rhC" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/71rhC/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="574"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
    
<p>Less than 10% of offenders in both Alamance and North Carolina are considered high-risk because of their classifications as  violent predators, aggregative offenders or recidivists. It's this minority that McAteer believes are the most dangerous to the community.</p>
    
<p>"I've had folks tell me they will reoffend and that it's just a matter of time," McAteer said. "There is just something in them. They're going to violate. Most of the people on the registry comply but you have that group we constantly have to keep check on."</p>

<p>But according to McAteer the only difference between the two types of offenders is the number of times they need to respond to compliance letters. A moderate- to low-risk offender is checked in on twice a year, while a high-risk offender is checked in on four times a year.</p>

<p>“The ostracizing of sexual offenders doesn’t contribute to public safety. If we are concerned that somebody presents a risk, it’s more effective to create restrictions that are managed on a case-by-case basis,” Levenson said. “That would make more sense than these blanket statements that undermine what allows a person to be a law-abiding citizen. This is not sympathizing with sex offenders; this is focusing on creating structures that builds lives and communities.”</p>
    
    <h2><strong>‘Any life can be transformed’</strong></h2>

<p> <a style=font-weight:bold href="http://www.sustainablealamance.org/" target = _blank>Sustainable Alamance</a> is one of two organizations in the county that offer free long-term assistance to felons re-entering society — regardless of their crime.</p>

<p>The organization, which currently operates out of Beverly Hills United Church of Christ in Burlington, focuses primarily on helping former criminals find full-time employment.</p>

<p>“If you find a place to live, you have to pay rent. If you get a car, you have to pay for gas. The economic pressures are still there,” said Phil Bowers, founder and executive director of Sustainable Alamance. “We’ve really tried to stay focused on the employment side and just do it really well. So, employers will know, if they get a Sustainable Alamance person the likelihood for success is very high.”</p>

<p>Bowers interviewed dozens of local employers to figure out what former criminals would have to do to get hired. Based on these interviews, Bowers created four expectations he requires of all the people he works with: clean drug trust, show up - on time, be teachable, no drama.</p>
        
<p>According to Bowers, who is also a pastor at the church, the organization runs under the motto: “Because you matter and because you are loved.”</p>

<p>“Anybody that lives in Alamance County and finds them self in a ditch, they automatically qualify. If they come to us and they want to be with us, then they are in. We don’t ask for any other qualifications other than that,” Bowers said. “We don’t turn anyone away. That’s not for us to be the judge.”</p>

            <p>Liz Vaughan, a member of Sustainable Alamance, listens to Paul Bowers, the organization's founder and executive director, preach during her first service in Beverly Hills United Church of Christ on Sunday, Dec. 8. "The gospel to all the poor is that the old mortages of eternity are not held against us, because God has declared a general amnesty on old bills unpaid, all old counts unsettled, all old hurts unhealed, all old sins unforgiven," Bowers preached.</p>

    <div class="story"> 

<p>Three years ago, Elon University students created an <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6568657-Sustainable-Alamance-Economic-Impact-Report.html" target ="_blank">economic impact report on Sustainable Alamance</a> for a class titled “Economics of Poverty” taught by Steven Bednar, associate professor of economics.</p>

<p>According to the report, from 2014 to 2017 the organization created “at least $5 million in benefits to Alamance County." The benefits came in the form of “taxes paid on wage earnings and the savings incurred due to the dramatic decrease in recidivism rates.”</p>

<p>Since he founded the organization in 2008, Bowers has helped place more than 75 former criminals in full-time positions. One of the hardest groups of felons to work with are sex offenders, he said.</p>
        
<p>“These folks are radioactive in the community. Everything is stacked against them — where they can walk, where they can live, where they can stand,” Bowers said. “There are a lot of ways you can end up on the registry, and none of them are good, but it is about how each person processes what that means.”</p>
        
                <div class=".video-small" style="padding-left: 25px; float:right;">
                <iframe width="426" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLKY68Nqlms" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                    
<p>Since the founding of Sustainable Alamance, Bowers has placed six sex offenders in full-time positions, mostly entry-level manufacturing jobs. While he sees this as a success, several county residents have been vocal about their disdain for offenders and have criticized Bowers for working with them.</p>

<p>Anytime he gets an angry phone call, snide comment, inflamed letter, or in one case an expletive-filled sticky note, asking why he works with offenders, Bowers simply refers them to an altered version of the organization's motto — “Because they matter and because all are loved.”</p>

<p>“We have to believe that any life can be transformed,” Bowers said.</p>

    <h2><strong>Life after registration</strong></h2>

<p>Sex offenders in North Carolina are required to stay on the registry for a minimum of 10 years. Only those not considered high-risk offenders are allowed to petition the court to be removed from the registry.</p>
    
<p>This year, 20 offenders in Alamance had the opportunity to petition. According to McAteer, who helps send the petition form to court, only four or five were granted. In 2020, nearly 1,180 registrants — living across the state — will have the opportunity to petition. Eighteen of them live in Alamance.</p>
        
<p>In two years, Daughtry will have the same opportunity. The chance to petition for what he calls "a clean slate." Based on his experience, Daughtry said the toughest part about being on the registry was changing his opinion of himself.</p>

<p>"Turning that shame into opportunity. That's the hardest part about being a sex offender and it's the hardest part about advocating for it," Daughtry said.</p>
        
                <span class="image left"><div><img src="images/conference.jpg" alt="A flier for the National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws' conference this summer." /><i>A flier for the National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws' conference this summer.</i></div></span>

<p>To continue advocating for a change in the law and to build a support system for registrants, Daughtry has been planning <a style=font-weight:bold href="https://conference.narsol.org/" target ="_blank">NARSOL's 12th annual conference</a>, which will be held in Raleigh for three days this summer, under the slogan "From acorn to oak."</p>
        
<p>"We're not talking about these things because we're told not to talk about these things," Daughtry said. "Lawyers and judges and people that have no expertise with sexual matters are deciding the fate of people involved in sexual matters. ... The people that should talking about it are the victims and the perpetrators. But instead, we just hear about it on the six o'clock news or the 11 o'clock news or the next day in the paper."</p>
        
<p>By creating a space for "problem solving and constructive conversation" for those involved in sexual matters, Daughtry wants the conference to reinforce people's resolve to fight for change. Daughtry and NARSOL hope to see the eventual abolishment of the registry across the country, or at least the shortening of the required years before petition.</p>

<p>"These are not bad people," Daughtry said. "These are bad circumstances, bad consequences and everybody's entitled to making a mistake." </p>
