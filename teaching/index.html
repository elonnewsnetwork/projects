<p>Senior Samantha Childers' love of music and teaching started back in middle school when she was in the all girls freshman choir. She attended a performance by the advanced vocal ensemble at her school and listened to them sing a song by Eric Whitacre, one of her favorite artists.</p>

<p>“Oh my gosh ... I have to be a part of that,” Childers recalled. “That was when I wanted to be a part of music and in that musical world.”</p>
    
<p>From then, Childers looked up to her music teacher Joy Clayton and was inspired by her way of teaching and incorporating topics of relevance into her music lessons to make it connect with the students.</p>	
                                      
<p>"What a gift I had to have this example of an amazing educator," Childers said. "I strive to be like her and it’s my goal to be like her and inspire students kinda like how I was inspired by her ... and I think that’s so cool."</p>

<p>According to Elon University's 2016 Undergraduate Report Card for the School of Education, 54 student teachers were in North Carolina schools after completing the teacher education program. Over 40 percent were employed in North Carolina.</p>
    
<p>Childers plans to be one of those employed North Carolina undergraduates after she graduates in 2018.</p>

<p class="childers">Childers is one of 19 senior teaching fellows at Elon University but that does not grant automatic entry into the Teacher Education program. The process for the program is broken into five transitions:</p>

<style>
    .childers {
        padding-top: 20px;
    }
</style>
    
<ol>
<li> Students must get a C or better in one of the two required 200 level classes, two recommendations from non edcuation faculty, and minimum qualifying scores on the SAT or Core Academic Skills for Educators.  </li>
<li> Students must maintain satisfactory performances in their classes and get positive recommendations from the department to continue. </li>
<li> Teacher candidates must receive approval by the Teacher Education Committee before they can start student teaching.</li>
<li> Teacher candidates must receive a final grade of a C or better in student teaching and meet all requirements on the Certification of Teaching Capacity. </li>
<li> Teacher candidates must submit a final transcript, portfolio, the Certification of Teaching Capacity form, and complete all testing requirements for North Carolina licensure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Special Education Professor Mary Knight-McKenna enjoys working with student teachers and seeing them grow throughout their college years.</p>

<p>Childers student teaches at Western Alamance High where she directs the school’s choir along with Sean Lucier, the current choir director at the school. She does a variety of lessons from vocal warm-ups to assisting students with their parts for their upcoming program.</p>    
    
<p>She is looking forward to being able to have a class of her own.</p>

<p>“I think I’m most excited to be able to lead the way for them,” Childers said. “So that they can learn about music and they can be excited about it.” </p>    
    
<p>For Childers, she can not wait to start teaching in North Carolina. But recent headlines makes a teaching position here sound less than desirable.</p>

<h3>Frustrations Ahead</h3>
								
</header>
<div class="content">

<p>In primary education, North Carolina ranks number 23 in comparison to other states according to U.S. News. This ranking is based on a number of factors including college readiness, math and reading scores, and preschool enrollment. But the state’s attrition rate is quite high amongst beginning teachers.</p>

<p>According to the 2016-2017 State of the Teaching Profession in North Carolina, 12.21 percent of beginning teachers (someone who has been teaching for less than three years) left their jobs in comparison to those not classified as a beginning teacher which was about 7.57 percent.</p>    

<p>Reasons for attrition are broken down into four categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Personal reasons like resigning due to family responsibilities, family relocation, and dissatisfied with teaching.</li>
<li>Initiated by Local Education Agencies like dismissal and their interim contract ended (and not rehired). </li>
<li>Beyond control of Local Education Agencies like retired with full benefits, death, and resigned due to movement required by Military Orders.</li>
<li>Other reasons including resigned for other and unknown reasons. </li>
</ol>
     
<p>Lucier has been teaching for nine years and has noticed the struggle of staying encouraged to work in North Carolina.</p>

<p>“The two states surrounding us, Virginia and South Carolina, pay new teachers $10,000 dollars or more as a starting teacher than in this state,” he said. “So yeah, that can be frustrating as well.”</p>
    
<p>The top paying states in the U.S. include New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California with New York earning the most at $75,279 dollars as their average salary. North Carolina ranks 35th in the nation with teachers earning an average salary of $45,947 dollars.</p>

<p>Knight-McKenna taught in Rhode Island before moving down to North Carolina and noticed different problems teachers up north face.</p>
    
<p>“It’s easier for new teachers to find jobs here,” she said. “Because up north a lot of teachers get employment and they stay with those districts for 25-30 years.”</p>
    
<p>And because the cost of living is more expensive in the north, teachers receive better pay. But Knight-McKenna says there is no hiding the fact that teachers here will not become millionaires.</p>
    
<p>“It’s just to say this is not for somebody whose intention it is to amass a lot of wealth, because it doesn’t lead to that,” she said. “But I find the people who want to do this work really don’t care as much ... at least in this stage of life.”</p>

<p>But Childers is not too worried about North Carolina teachers getting paid less. She just wants to teach.</p>

<p>"Of course the salary and benefits and all that goes into that is important," Childers said. "But I would like to have a job that I really love and where I think I can make a difference."</p>

<h3>Going Forward</h3>
</header>
<div class="content">

										
<p>Elon is one of five universities offering the North Carolina Teaching Fellows (NCTF) Program. The other four universities include UNC Charlotte, UNC Chapel Hill, Meredith College, and NC State University. </p>  

<p>The program is being reintroduced, after being scrapped in 2011 because of budget cuts, and is designed to meet the needs of the state by focusing on areas where teachers are needed the most. Those areas include special education teachers and teachers in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field. </p>

<p>The program started in 1986 to fill the need for recruiting teachers in North Carolina. Alamance County School Board Chair Allison Gant said taking the program away was a lost incentive for potential educators.</p>
    
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/405126021%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-7uoPa&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
    
<p>In addition to the reintroduction of the fellows program, Gant also believes that having local communities supporting their schools will bring in more teachers.</p>

<p>Which is something that drew Special Education Teacher Chelsea Rafetto to Chapel Hill.</p>

<p>"Even the kids feel the moral support," Rafetto said. "They feel like they're being helped ... they feel like academics matter."</p>
    
<p>And community support is what Childers appreciated the most during her time in school.</p>
    
<p>"I feel this responsibility to give back to that community and the state that I was educated in," Childers said. "I feel like I have a responsibility to stay and help educate the students that live here just like I did."</p>
    
<p>In Alamance county, there are groups such as the Alamance Citizens for Education who provide support for local schools through their program like Classroom Closet. It is stocked by local businesses and volunteers and provides resources like paper, notebooks, and pencils. Teachers pay an annual fee to shop in the facility four times a year.</p>

<p>Gant believes support is the least communities can do for teachers.</p>

<p>"I think the most important thing to remember is that we have to support our teachers and provide what they need," Gant said. "I think that's a way to draw teachers into a community or a school district as well." </p>
