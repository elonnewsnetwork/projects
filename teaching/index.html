<p>According to Elon University's 2016 Undergraduate Report Card for the School of Education, 54 student teachers were in North Carolina schools after completing the teacher education program. Over 40 percent were employed in North Carolina.</p>
    
<p>Senior Samantha Childers plans to be one of those employed North Carolina undergraduates after she graduates in 2018.</p>

<p>Originally from Ohio, Samantha and her family moved to North Carolina when she was around three years old but she considers North Carolina as her home state because she grew up and went to school here.</p>

<p>Her love of music and teaching started back in middle school when she was in the all girls freshman choir. She attended a performance by the advanced vocal ensemble at her school and listened to them sing a song by Eric Whitacre, one of her favorite artists.</p>

<p>“Oh my gosh...I have to be a part of that,” Samantha recalled as she remembered their performance. “That was when I wanted to be a part of music and in that musical world.”</p>
	
<p>From then, Samantha looked up to her music teacher Joy Clayton and was inspired by her way of teaching and incorporating topics of relevance into her music lessons to make it connect with the students.</p>	
    
 <!-- Here's an example of using an embedded video from YouTube -->                                        
<p>"What a gift I had to have this example of an amazing educator," said Samantha. "I strive to be like her and it’s my goal to be like her and inspire students kinda like how I was inspired by her...and I think that’s so cool."</p>

<p>Samantha is one of 19 senior teaching fellows at Elon University but that does not grant automatic entry into the Teacher Education program. The process for the program is broken into five transitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transition Point 1: Application and Admission to Teacher Education</li>
<li>Transition Point 2: Satisfactory Progress in Teacher Education</li>
<li>Transition Point 3: Entry into Student Teaching</li>
<li>Transition Point 4: Exit from Student Teaching </li>
<li>Transition Point 5: Program Completion and Recommendation for Licensure</li>
</ul>

<p>At each transition point, students must meet all requirements and get approval from faculty to continue to move towards the next transition point.</p>

<p>Special Education Professor Dr. Mary Knight-McKenna enjoys working with student teachers and seeing them grow throughout their college years.</p>

<p>Samantha student teaches at Western Alamance High where she directs the school’s choir along with Sean Lucier, the current teacher at the school. Samantha does a variety of lessons from vocal warm-ups to assisting students with their parts for their upcoming program.</p>    
    
<p>She is looking forward to being able to have a class of her own.</p>

<p>“I think I’m most excited to be able to lead the way for them,” said Samantha. “So that they can learn about music and they can be excited about it.” </p>    
    
<p>For Samantha, she can not wait to start teaching in North Carolina. But recent headlines makes a teaching position here sound less than desirable.</p>

<h3>Frustrations Ahead</h3>
								
</header>
<div class="content">

<p>In education, North Carolina ranks number 21 in comparison to other states according to U.S. News. But the state’s attrition rate is quite high amongst beginning teachers. According to the 2016-2017 State of the Teaching Profession in North Carolina, 12.21 percent of beginning teachers left their jobs in comparison to those not classified as a beginning teacher which was about 7.57 percent.</p>

<p>Reasons for attrition are broken down into four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal Reasons</li>
<li>Initiated by LEA (local education agencies)</li>
<li>Beyond Control of LEA</li>
<li>Other Reasons </li>
</ul>

<p>Personal reasons accounted for over half of attrition rates and some of those reasons included: resigned due to family responsibilities, family relocation, and dissatisfied with teaching.</p>
     
<p>Sean Lucier, the choir director at Western Alamance High School, has been teaching for nine years and has noticed the struggle of staying encouraged to work in North Carolina.</p>

<p>“The two states surrounding us, Virginia and South Carolina, pay new teachers ten thousand dollars or more as a starting teacher than in this state,” he said. “So yeah, that can be frustrating as well.”</p>
    
<p>The top paying states in the U.S. include New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California with New York earning the most at $75,279 dollars as their average salary. North Carolina ranks as one as the lowest with teachers earning an average salary of $45,947 dollars.</p>

<p>Dr. Knight-McKenna taught in Rhode Island before moving down to North Carolina and noticed different problems teachers up north face.</p>
    
<p>“It’s easier for new teachers to find jobs here,” she said. “Because up north a lot of teachers get employment and they stay with those districts for 25-30 years.”</p>
    
<p>And because the cost of living is more expensive in the north, teachers receive better pay. But Dr. Knight-McKenna says there is no hiding the fact that teachers here will not become millionaires.</p>
    
<p>“It’s just to say this is not for somebody whose intention it is to amass a lot of wealth, because it doesn’t lead to that,” she said. “But I find the people who want to do this work really don’t care as much...at least in this stage of life.”</p>

<p>But Samantha is not too worried about North Carolina teachers getting paid less. She just wants to teach.</p>

<p>"Of course the salary and benefits and all that goes into that is important," said Samantha. "But I would like to have a job that I really love and where I think I can make a difference."</p>

<h3>Going Forward</h3>
</header>
<div class="content">

										
<p>In 1986, North Carolina introduced a teaching fellows program that required students to stay and teach in North Carolina after graduation. But because of budget cuts, the program was scrapped in 2011 and Alamance County School Board Chair Allison Gant said taking the program away was a lost incentive for potential educators.</p>
    
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="./index_files/saved_resource(1).html"></iframe>
    
<p>The program is being reintroduced and is designed to meet the needs of the state by focusing on areas where teachers are needed the most. Those areas include special education teachers and teachers in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field. </p>
    

<p>Elon is one of five universities offering the North Carolina Teaching Fellows (NCTF) Program. The other four universities include UNC Charlotte, UNC Chapel Hill, Meredith College, and NC State University. </p>  

<p>With the fellows program, students will receive a scholarship for up to four years and some of their loans will be forgiven after a certain amount of years of teaching.</p>

<p>In addition to the reintroduction of the fellows program, Gant also believes that having local communities supporting their schools will bring in more teachers. In Alamance county, there are groups such as the Alamance Citizens for Education who provide support for local schools through their program like Classroom Closet where teachers pay an annual fee to shop in the facility four times a year.</p>

<p>Gant believes support is the least we can do for teachers</p>

     <!-- Here's an example of using a pullquote in the story --> 
    
<blockquote>"I think the most important thing to remember is that we have to support our teachers and provide what they need. I think that’s a way to draw teachers into a community or a school district as well."<div style="text-align:right;">— Allison Gant, Chair of Alamance County Board of Education</div></blockquote>

<p>And the strong community ties is what encourages Samantha to stay in North Carolina.</p>
