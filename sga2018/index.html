       <p> Elon University's Student Government Association (SGA) is holding elections soon, and it's up to YOU who represents your class and study body in 2018-2019 . Voting will run from Monday, February 19th until 5 p.m. February 20th.</p>

<p> More than 2,200 students voted in last year's election, making up about one third of the total undergraduate population. The difference in votes between candidates can sometimes be down to single digits. The purpose of this site is to inform you of candidate's platforms so you can make an informed decision about who represents you. As a reminder, you are able to vote for your class senators as well as the executive committee. And yes, current seniors can vote (for the executive board).</p>

<p> The purpose of SGA, according to its constitution is, "to represent the rights and opinions of the student body in a manner consistent with the mission of Elon University, to provide for appropriate student activities, and to join with the faculty and administrators of the University in building a stronger, more effective educational community."
