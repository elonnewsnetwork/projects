<p>“No. There is no way, it’s too dangerous.” </p>

<p>It wasn’t the response he wanted, but the one he expected. But his upcoming birthday still gave him some leverage.</p>

<p>“Fine. If you don’t want to buy me one, can I make my own?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Go for it.”</p>

<p>Shan left his parents sitting on the couch knowing that he was the only one in the house taking himself seriously.

        <p> Three years from that moment, Shan is now a freshman at Elon University and has successfully designed and built two electric motorcycles. A passion that Shan is planning on pursuing both at Elon and beyond.</p>

 <p>His passion for engineering didn’t start with motorcycles, but something much simpler.</p>

 <p>To his parent’s annoyance, as a child Shan had the habit of taking apart all of his toys. The first victim of this habit was a small fiber-optic flashlight.</p>

 <p>“He was about ten years old and everytime we would buy him a toy, he would open it up just to see how the process worked,” said Laila Roy, Shan’s mother. “That was when we saw that he was starting to turn into something.”</p>

 <p>At the time, both Laila and her husband Farid, were unsure what that “something” was going to be. Shan’s interest quickly evolved from flashlights to boats, to computers, to cameras, to keyboards and now to motorcycles.</p>

 <p>Neither parent could have guessed that their simple response of  “go for it,” would have peaked their then-almost 16-year-old son’s interest in motorcycles.</p>
  
 <p>“We were sure he wouldn’t be able to,” Laila said. “We didn’t know what he was capable of.”

        <p>Now, at the age of 19 and after two successful motorcycle builds, Shan’s parents are fully aware of what their son is capable of. While they weren’t originally so sure of his success at the age of 16, Shan always was.</p>

<p>Despite having no experience when Shan started his first build, he knew that he could figure it out. So he just continued with his childhood habit of taking things apart and putting them back together.</p>

<p>“I had this crazy idea,” Shan said. “I had this bicycle and I was looking at motors and I got the biggest motor I could get, a controller and a battery … I made a really simple bracket to put on the water bottle holster and made my first electric bike.”</p>

<p>When screwed into the water bottle holster, the simple bracket held the three other parts together. But the bracket that would have fixed his parents not wanting to buy him a dirt bike, didn't work out as well as he had planned.

        <p>“It was a really long process, I don’t even consider that as my first build because it didn’t work out,” Shan said. “It didn’t really work because I had no idea what a gear ratio was, I was using a typical bike ratio, so you need a lot more torque and that motor couldn’t provide it.”</p>

 <p>A gear ratio directly relates to a vehicle's top speed and acceleration time. In his first build Shan had accidently calculated a gear ratio that the motor he was using could not provide. The electric motorcycle never started.</p>

 <p>But the failure only delayed Shan’s dream of owning his own motorcycle.</p>

 <p>“Then I had another crazy idea. This didn’t work but I’m going to try something twenty times harder and build my own bike from scratch,” Shan said. “I have no idea what I was thinking because I failed on an easy project but I decided to challenge myself and do something completely unnatural to me.”</p>

 <p>Shan’s next, “crazy idea” started with him visiting every auto store in his hometown of Mooresville, North Carolina and asking the owners which materials were best to buy to build his own motorcycle.</p>

 <p>At first, like his parents, each store owner who Shan asked didn’t believe he could do it.</p>

 <p>“Most of them were like ‘You can’t do it, just buy a bike,’” Shan said. “But it kind of motivated me because I figured I could do it.”</p>

 <p>And he did.

        <p>Ignoring their advice, Shan continued with his plans to build his own electric motorcycle. His childhood habit of taking things apart had gotten him this far, so he kept the habit going. </p>

 <p>“He took every bike that we had in the house, he tore them apart and he used one thing from one bike, and one thing from another bike and he built one,” Farid said. “We were just amazed.”</p>

 <p>From design to ride, his first attempt at building his own electric motorcycle took him a little over a year to complete. The end product of his first real build may have been a success but the year it took him to build the motorcycle had been a difficult one.</p>

 <p>“Everything that could have gone wrong on the electrical side, went wrong,” Shan said. “It sucked, I was so discouraged.”</p>

 <p>After all the discouragement, a years wait, three busted controllers and a short-circuited battery, his motorcycle was finally ready to be ridden.</p>

 <p>It worked for a day.

<p>“Well less than, my friend had an ATV down the road, so we were riding together and the wire of my bike stripped out,” Shan said. “So it broke down and that was the end of that.”</p>

<p>But a day was enough.</p>

<p>“Despite it breaking, I was still so happy because it had been a whole year in the making and my bike was finally working,” Shan said. “I was happy just knowing that it worked, it was a great feeling.”</p>
 
<p>The failures of his first build and Shan’s first-ride experience set the tone for his next build.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to get discouraged when everything is going wrong,” Shan said. “That’s your first bike build, you don’t know if you can do it. It wasn’t hard for me to get discouraged at the time but I just kept running through it.”</p>

<p>Shan now takes pleasure in knowing he can go back to every auto story in Mooresville and say “I told you so.” </p>

<p>“It sounds kind of cocky but it's true,” he said.

<p> With his newfound confidence, Shan began the process of designing the next version of his motorcycle. Shan’s goal being to design a motorcycle he could ride more than once.</p>

<p>To guarantee the same mistakes weren’t made again, Shan used lessons and resources from his first build and applied them to his current one.</p>

<p>“The best thing that came out of my first build were my contacts because now that I had my first bike out of the way, I knew where to go for everything,” Shan said.</p>

<p>After spending a summer sketching new designs, Shan decided on the drawing that he would use to model his new motorcycle after. </p>

<p>In order to get all the right materials for his brand-new design, Shan went to a Richard ‘Dick’ Timmons, a foreman and a designer at Nitro Manufacturing who he had met on his first build.</p>

<p>“Working with Nitro and Dick has always been a really good experience, I’ve been working with them since the second bike, it’s not only because of how quick they get me my parts but also because of how they work with me,” Shan said. “Before any part gets cut, Dick and I will sit down and analyze it, make sure it’ll be the right cut and after we’ll sit down again and go over what I need to fix.”

<p>Timmons specializes on working with “off-the-wall fabrications and prototyping.”</p>

<p>“The first time I met Shan, I was thinking what in the world did I get into,” Timmons said. “But I have a lot of respect for him … there are no ‘ifs’ or ‘buts’ with him, if he wants it, he makes it makes it. The world needs a lot of engineers like him.”</p>

<p>Shan’s ability to learn from his mistakes is an invaluable trait that Timmons believes will propel his success.</p>

<p>“He is a sponge,” Timmons said. “He is here to learn, he knows to listen to people like me and people who are helping him. He absorbs all of it and that’s what makes him so good.”</p>

<p>Being able to absorb information and advice from others is what Timmons believes made Shan’s next motorcycle so successful.</p>

<p>Not only did Shan learn from his electrical mistakes but also from his structural ones. While the original goal was to build a motorcycle he could ride more than once, Shan also wanted a vehicle that would stand out a little more.</p>

<p>“I wanted it to be unique, something that everyone would look at but I also wanted to keep a similar shape to a regular dirt bike,” Shan said. “So I just took the basic outline of a bike and started from there.”

<p>With Timmons helping him cut parts and with Canadian and Californian companies supplying him with other materials, Shan built the latest version of his motorcycle in just over four months.</p>

<p>Riding his motorcycle for the first time was as special of a feeling as he remembers.</p>

<p>“The best moment after that build was the initial ride, it’s a feeling you can’t get anywhere else. It sticks with you for hours if not days,” Shan said. “It’s a proud feeling.”</p>

<p>To this day, Shan can still ride this version of his electric motorcycle.

<p>Before the pride from his success had even faded, Shan had already started working on the next and better version of his motorcycle. In his mind, while his current version may have been a success — it could still be improved.</p>

<p>“I didn’t take off enough weight, it is pretty heavy and it’s really big,” Shan said. “For the next bike, I have it designed so that it is smaller which will save a lot of weight.”</p>

<p>The weight of the motorcycle isn’t the only major change that Shan wants to apply to his new design.</p>

<p>“The next design is different, it is more futuristic and I am a fan of that,” Shan said. “So I am excited.”</p>

<p>According to his parents, Shan’s inability to stop thinking about improvements and future builds is just a part of his personality.</p>

<p>“Shan has a restless soul,” Laila said. “If he is on a project and even if he hasn’t finished it yet, he is already thinking about his next project and how to improve.”

<p>This restlessness is constantly at the forefront of Shan’s mind.</p>

<p>“My mind is always running about how I can improve stuff and fix problems,” Shan said. “I don’t sleep a lot at night … I’m just up working and even if I’m not working, I’m just sitting and thinking.”</p>

<p>To Shan, sleeping is a luxury he is more than happy to sacrifice for his motorcycles. </p>

<p>This passion for engineering is one that Shan has been trying to continue at Elon. A task that has been a made more difficult because of the limited options Shan has as an aspiring engineer at the university.</p>

<p>“I knew from the start I wanted to study engineering,” Shan said. “While I was interested in Elon’s dual-degree engineering program, I wasn’t sure if it was for me, which made me really hesitant to come to Elon.”</p>

<p>But as his senior year at Pine Lake Preparatory was coming to an end, Shan looked past his doubts and decided that Elon was still worth the try.</p>

<p>While Shan’s enjoyed his first year he continued to have doubts about his future as an engineer at Elon. But an announcement from the College of Arts & Sciences completely changed his mind.</p>

<p>“Not having any other options other than the dual-degree program really made me think about transferring to a school that had a more established engineering program,” Shan said. “But after I heard Elon would have a new engineering program in the fall, I decided to stay to at least try the new program.”</p>


<p>In the fall of the 2018-2019 academic school year Elon will be offering a four-year bachelor of science degree in Engineering.</p>

<p>Students in this major can declare concentrations in biomedical engineering, computer engineering or design their own concentrations if their interests lie beyond the two offered fields.</p>

<p>This new program will be established in addition to Elon’s current dual-degree engineering program. The current program allowed students to study engineering at Elon for three years then transfer to an accredited engineering program for another two years.</p>

<p>The push for the new program stems from student interest remaining at Elon.</p>

        <p class="pull-quote-title">Director of the dual-degree engineering program</p>
         </div>

<p>“We are providing this degree for our students because they conveyed to us their interest in staying at Elon and finishing their degrees here, so we made that possible,” said Scott Wolter, the director of the dual-degree engineering program. “The change was driven by student interest and we are very excited about it.”</p>

<p>The start of the program works perfectly with Shan’s plans, in the fall of his sophomore year he plans on declaring his major in engineering and designing a concentration in mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>A possibility that is well within grasp.</p>

<p>“Elon’s faculty is devoted to providing great educational experiences for all our students,” Wolter said. “We will work with any student to figure out their passion and how to incorporate that into their education.”</p>

<p>In addition to being able to design his concentration, if Shan switches majors he will also have a personal faculty advisor from the engineering department.</p>

<p>A professional adult figure in the engineering field that Shan hopes will act as an advisor but also become more a mentor.</p>

<p>“It would be nice if the program helped me find a mentor at Elon that would help improve my builds and make be a better engineer,” Shan said.</p>

<p>While the new engineering major at Elon will hopefully provide Shan with more mentorship, his parents also hope it will lead him down other engineering tracks.</p>

<p>“Bikes are great and that’s his passion and he should go for it but our dream for him is to go beyond that,” Laila said. “He can have his bike business and have his own company but he has also been thinking about building low-cost prosthetics. If he can go into that and provide change for somebody, that would be our dream.”</p>

<p>Whether Shan will be creating electric motorcycles or low-cost prosthetics in the future is still uncertain, but Timmons is sure that the one thing he will be creating is change. </p>

<p>“He comes across as a normal kid, but when he starts showing you what he is capable of doing, it’s unbelievable. Especially when you see the things he has accomplished by himself,” Timmons said. “It’s going to be hard for him to get a job that fully uses him because I don’t think anybody will really understand what he is capable of doing.”

<p>Timmons hopes that Shan’s future in engineering will lead him back to Mooresville and Nitro, but he doubts it.</p>

<p>“From day one I wanted him to work here but I know I can’t hold him back,” Timmons said. “Because he’s going to way bigger places than what we are and hopefully one day he will be able to help me a little bit like I am helping him now.”</p>

<p>Now nearing the end of his freshman year, Shan’s parents are already looking into what his next three years at Elon are going to look like.</p>

<p>An important part of Shan’s future at Elon being an engineering internship  — an internship with Tesla Motors being his dream.</p>

<p>Tesla’s drive to create affordable electric cars and other energy-efficient vehicles is what attracts Shan most to the company. According to their website, Tesla’s mission and goal is “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>A mission and goal Shan wants to spend a summer and the rest of his life reaching for.</p>

<p>“I believe it is the future, eventually everyone will go to electric,” Shan said. “I’m not saying now, I love gas-powered bikes and cars. I am an enthusiast, but there is also something about electric vehicles that is more convenient.”
</p>
                   
<p>While Shan has been spending a lot of time thinking about the future, his past has had an interesting way of playing into the present.</p>
 
<p>“In lower school I was known as ‘The Battery Man’ because I always had batteries. If anyone ever needed batteries, I took enjoyment in looking for the right batteries that fit,” Shan said. “I don’t really know why honestly. But it really evolved and maybe that’s where it started — it evolved into what you see now because everything I do now has to do with batteries.”</p>

<p>His focus on efficient motors is what Shan believes will set him apart from other engineers.</p>

<p>“I hope that after this next build, I could somehow land a sponsor and get some seed money to start a business,” Shan said. “I hope that in the future I could start a company that either builds energy efficient bikes or focuses on making efficient motors for other vehicles.”</p>

<p>Shan isn’t sure if his dream of working with efficient motors will come to fruition, but he is sure that he’ll have at least one sponsor.</p>

<p>“I am going to be one of the sponsors for him,” said Farida Roy, Shan’s grandmother. “I am praying that he has success in whatever he is doing and I hope that one day everybody is going to say ‘Oh, Shan Roy,’ that I want to hear.” </p>

<p>Whether Farida will ever hear that will stay unknown for now, but what she can be sure of is that Shan’s journey to turn the motorcycle industry electric will continue.
