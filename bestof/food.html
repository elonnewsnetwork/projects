<p> “The Root is the best place to get a good quality burger at an affordable price,” Falshaw said.</p>
<p>For others, their love for the restaurant comes from the ability to have a flexible dining option that fits their busy schedule. 	The Root offers the ability to dine in or call in a to-go order for their customer’s convenience.</p>
<p> “It’s definitely my favorite one out of the restaurant strips,” said senior Avery Jamison.  “I’m always someone who is on the go, so if I can call in to a restaurant to order out, than I tend to go back.”</p>
<p> The Root is located on West Lebanon Avenue and is open Tuesday-Saturday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and on Mondays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. </p>

        <p> The Elon University community has a sweet tooth for Smitty’s Homemade Ice Cream.</p>
<p> “We love Elon so much, so it’s really nice Elon loves us back” said Amy Nakhle, the owner of Smitty’s.</p>
<p> Opening in 2002, the ice cream store instantly became a fan-favorite for Elon students.</p>
<p> “We are at every football game,” Nakhle said.</p>
<p> Smitty’s is the official ice cream of the Elon Phoenix, which she said contributes to its popularity.</p>
<p> “People like it because the ice cream is fresh and homemade,” said freshman Emily Pisani.</p>
<p> Pisani likes Smitty’s because of its convenience and affordability — as well as her go-to order of chocolate ice cream with rainbow sprinkles.</p>
<p> Nakhle said the good vibes at Elon radiate throughout the store the minute people walk through the doors.</p>
<p> “Students feel warm, and there’s a natural attraction there,” Nakhle said. “Smitty’s is a local, homemade business, which also attracts customers.” </p>
<p> Nakhle thanks the Elon community for their continued support.</p>
<p> “Here’s to many, many more years,” Nakhle said.

        <p> The Oak House opened in 2014 and quickly became a hotspot for students to stop by and fuel up with morning, afternoon or evening coffee.</p>
<p> Functioning as a hub where students can hold study sessions, meet with professors or spend time with friends, The Oak House’s unique atmosphere and quality coffee makes it a prominent part of the Elon community, according to owner Phil Smith.</p>
<p>Smith said there is a lot of effort in trying to provide a quality coffee product and, “People are putting a more conscious effort to choose something that’s local. The milk we use in our coffee is about 14 miles from here. <p>Our coffee is roasted 25 minutes from here that sources responsibly. People are a little more attentive to these things than they were several years ago.”</p>
<p>When Smith told former Vice President of Student Life Smith Jackson about his idea to open The Oak House, Jackson said, “Sounds like a place where Cheers meets Central Perk.” For Smith, that is exactly what has happened.</p>
<p>Sophomore Lindeman Edgar is a frequent visitor of The Oak House and says she goes there almost every day.</p>
<p>“There is constant change with the different kind of brews, like The Oak House Special, and a lot of local products are used. It’s amazing,” Edgar said.</p>

                <p> Using local food from local farms, $1 slice night and build-your-own pizzas are all ways Pandora’s Pies has branded itself in the Elon community for its delectable pizzas. The locally owned pizza shop won Elon News Network’s Best of 2017 pizza category. It’s open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and open until midnight on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>The restaurant is co-owned and operated by Peter Ustach ’09, who also won Elon’s Top 10 Under 10 Award in 2013, an award distinguishing Elon’s top alumni who haven’t been out of college for more than 10 years. When he decided to open the restaurant, he said he did so because the only pizza available was Dominos.</p>
<p>“This is a college town without a cool pizza place,” Ustach said when he first opened Pandora’s. “We want it to be a place where you can get a quick bite to eat at a reasonable price. Subway is the only other quick place to eat that’s not owned by Elon.”</p>
<p>Junior Connor Quinn is thankful Ustach made it. </p>
<p>“Padora’s has great food between pizza and sandwiches and it’s wicked convenient right on campus,” he said. </p>
