        <p> Global neighborhood has won the vote for the best neighborhood on campus.
It was built in 2013 as part of Elon University’s 25-year strategic plan. Some amenities in Global include full classrooms, personalized thermostats and close access to Lakeside Dining Hall and Global Commons.</p>
<p>There are five dorms in Global that house 595 students, according to the Elon website. Additionally, Global is home to Living and Learning Communities (LLCs) such as the International LLC in Global D. The buildings are separated and named after different rivers of the world: Tigris, Orinoco, Thames, Yukon and Zambezi.</p>
<p>“All of the neighborhoods are unique and have something special to offer students,” said sophomore Arianne Payne. “Global, in particular, is definitely a place that will push you to examine the world you’re living in — in ways other neighborhoods might not. It does a great job of combining living and learning at Elon in a cohesive way.” </p>
<p>There is a competition between houses to get the most neighborhood participation points. The Global community also holds neighborhood dinners and meetings to bring students even closer together.</p>
<p>“The best part is how unique the residents are,” said junior Charleen Lopes. “They all offer a different feel, which is cool.”</p>
<p>I lived in historic before and it was a very traditional college feel — Global is not like that at all.” </p>
            <p> Global neighborhood is also a great location for students who want to walk to soccer games, tailgates or football games. Though a new set of dorms is being built now, it’s the modern and innovative Global that wins for the best neighborhood.

        <p> The Station at Mill Point is home to 24 apartment buildings for upperclassmen, as well as the Love Family Student Commons, which boasts a fitness center, kitchen and fireplace. Outside, volleyball courts, a communal garden and an outdoor pool provide residents with amenities that facilitate community engagement.</p>
<p>“When I show pictures of Mill Point to my friends at schools back in California, they can never believe how nice the neighborhood is,” said senior Max Herrera.
Named after the original railroad station, Mill Point residents have the opportunity to come together for traditions such as the community-wide trick-or-treat, the learn-to-cook series, wine-and-art nights and more.</p>
<p>“In the end, it is the closest to independent living within Residence Life, but provides the same high-quality living-and-learning programming to its residents,” said Community Director Billy Baker. “Residents feel a sense of belonging to the overall neighborhood and are invested in its theme of ‘Life After Elon.’”

        <p> Located in Daniel Commons, Qdoba Mexican Eats has shown itself to be a favorite spot for students to eat.</p>
<p>Qdoba offers a full menu of classic Mexican entrees, including burritos, grilled quesadillas, nachos and a variety of tacos, all of which are prepared exhibition-style in view of the customer. Customers order by selecting an entree, then choosing its ingredients. The something-for-everybody menu works. By around 6:30 p.m., business picks up, and it appears as if the whole campus decided to eat there at once.</p>
<p>Freshman Alison Simmons frequently eats at Qdoba. She finds the atmosphere as “vibrant and friendly.”</p>
<p>“There are always people coming and going,” Simmons said. “I’m not surprised it’s one of the most popular spots to eat on campus.”</p>
<p>Qdoba is all about options. Burritos can be ordered with the customer’s choice of meat — chicken, pork or beef — or just vegetables, with a variety of salsas ranging from a mild pico de gallo to a fiery habañero.</p>
<p>Freshman Alexandra Smith is also enthusiastic about the fresh and bold flavors Qdoba offers, and she often makes the trek all the way from Historic Neighborhood.</p>
                <p>“The food there is amazing,” she said. “My favorite thing to get is the burrito bowl.”</p>
<p>As one of the only places on campus serving Mexican food, Qdoba is in high demand, and popular signature flavors include the knock-out tacos, loaded tortilla soup and the creamy queso.</p>
<p>Qdoba is open Mon.-Wed. from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m., Thurs.-Friday from 12 p.m. to 1 a.m., Saturday from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Sunday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Qdoba accepts meal swipes, food dollars, meal dollars, Phoenix cash, cash and credit.

        <p>Students looking for a quiet room in which to relieve themselves have found many hidden spots to hit the head, but one restroom rules them all. Tucked away in upstairs Lakeside are clean, polished bathrooms that rarely see regular visitors.</p>
<p>The luxurious latrines have developed a cult following of sorts, gaining renown as a space to find some solitude in the midst of a long day. These secluded stalls were opened in February 2013, so it’s no surprise that they’re part of Elon loo lore.</p>
<p>Just to the right of the entrance to Lakeside Dining Hall is a set of stairs leading up to a large conference room. While it’s sometimes used for events such as Inter-Residence Council Bingo, it’s also home to conferences and events attracting off-campus visitors. Unlike most bathrooms designed for regular student use, this spot boasts gleaming marble countertops and spacious stalls.</p>

        <p> Oaks neighborhood was voted as having the best parking lot in Elon News Network’s Best Of edition. The parking  lot is within walking distance of Rhodes Stadium, Alumni Gym and the currently under-construction Schar Center — which makes it a prime location to park for athletic events.</p> <p>Academically, it is in close proximity to the School of Communications and other buildings in the Historic neighborhood. It is also right across the street from the Moseley Center. Senior Donita Sharkey, an apartment manager in Oaks, says she is prideful of Oaks for a number of different factors, but knowing that students like to park there is an added bonus. </p> 
<p>“Oaks is the neighborhood that cultivates a sure sense of community while providing the tools and environment for students to grow independently, and ultimately succeed,” Sharkey said. “I’m also glad we are able to create a place where people would want to park.”</p>

        <p> The annual Festival of Holiday Lights celebrates and honors both alumni and senior donors of Elon University through the lighting of luminaries.</p>
<p>Each luminary had the name of an alumni or senior donor and was lit on Dec. 5 for the fourth consecutive year of the festival.</p>
<p>More than 4,300 alumni, donors and members of the 1889 Society, a group recognizing donors who have gifted to Elon in two or more consecutive years, were recognized this year.</p>
            <p>“I wanted a luminary because it was a way of giving back to Elon after four years,” said Lizzy Bulloch, a recent Elon graduate. “Seeing them all together made me feel part of the Elon community.”</p>
<p>Bulloch donated to the school through her luminary and used it as a way to connect with other graduated friends.</p>
<p>“A lot of my friends also donated and got a luminary,” Bulloch said. “On the day, we all went and got hot chocolate and then went to look for each of them. It was actually a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>The Festival of Holiday Lights has historically taken place prior to first semester exams as one of the events planned to help students de-stress during the testing period.</p>
<p>“It’s a nice idea of community, bringing people together to celebrate the lighting of the luminaries,” said freshman student Imanol Yepez-Frias. “It’s a really nice Elon tradition.”</p>

        <p> Take one look at the aptly-named carnival cookie from Acorn Coffee Shop, and you are instantly transported to a bright and happy place. Red, green, blue and yellow M&M’s nestled in dough peek out at you from behind the glass case at Acorn.</p>     <p>The carnival cookie recipe is simple — just mix some M&M’s into whole-wheat dough and bake. The carnival cookie is Acorn’s only cookie made with whole-wheat dough and was designed to be a healthier option for students with a sweet tooth. While manager Jackie Traywick and the rest of the Acorn staff said there are rarely any carnival cookies left at the end of each night, they were surprised to hear that the only better-for-you cookie Acorn offers was the students’ favorite. “The students love them. Once we stopped carrying the Acorn cookie, which is back now, everyone switched over to the carnival cookie,” Traywick said.</p>
<p>The Acorn staff agrees the carnival cookies are good but say their favorites include classic chocolate chip and sugar cookies; but there is something about the carnival cookie that students cannot get enough of.</p>
<p>“I like them — especially how some of them are square. None of the other cookies are like that. But I highly, highly recommend them,” said sophomore Julia Walter.

        <p> The Oak House on North Williamson Avenue was voted the best study spot on campus, and it’s no surprise since the atmosphere not only offers visitors calming coffee shop music, but caffeine to fuel the mind for studying. If you’re lucky enough to get a table or even a spot on a couch during exam week, you’re sure to be on your way to good grades.
   With two sections to do work — the coffee side, and the bar side — The Oak House is roomy enough for study group meetings or just putting in earphones and studying. Even when the day turns into night, studying can be paired with a glass of wine or a local craft beer. </p>
<p>Senior Brittany Coppla has utilized The Oak House as a study spot since freshman year for both hitting the books and socializing. Spending nearly 12 hours a week studying, the coffee shop is also a place to see friends.</p>
<p>“It’s a balance between an academic atmosphere and a social atmosphere,” Coppla said. “If you want a study break, you’re guaranteed to know somebody at The Oak House, but if you want to power through work, it’s also conducive.”</p>
<p>Another avid The Oak House customer is senior Azzurra Catucci who spends at least 10 hours a week studying specifically at The Oak House. While the vibes are productive in the dimly lit coffee shop, Azzurra enjoys the social atmosphere to keep her focused.</p>
<p>“I can always count on running into a friend to keep me motivated,” Catucci said. “Whether it’s cramming before a test, or looking to collaborate on projects, The Oak House is the perfect spot for studying.”

        <p> Elon University is known for its beautiful fountains. The two main fountains, Koury Business Center’s Chandler Fountain and the Alamance Fountain, provide additional attraction to the already Elon University beautiful campus.</p>
                <p>Freshman Lindsay Silverman enjoys the role fountains play in the Elon community.</p>
<p>“They wholly represent the beauty of the Elon community,” Silverman said. “Not only does their physical beauty provide a constant stunning image that you can always go to and admire, but they are a unifying source on campus that seems to be a common enjoyment by all students.”</p>
                <p>This year, students voted the Chandler Fountain as the best fountain on campus.</p>
<p>When asked about why the Chandler Fountain got voted best fountain on campus, freshman Mabel Kitchens said, “Because it’s the biggest one.”</p>
<p>Chandler Fountain features three levels, a 4-foot waterfall and numerous jets computer programmed to create various patterns of display. In 2017, it celebrated 10 years of operation, opening with the rest of the Koury Business Center complex in 2007.</p>
<p>The fountain is named after Wallace L. Chandler, ’49. After serving on the board of trustees for 37 years, he was recognized by Elon, receiving the Distinguished Alumni Service Award in 1978.</p>
<p>One of Elon’s traditions includes jumping into the fountains before graduation. Kitchens looks forward to the opportunity to make a splash.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where it started, how it started or why it started, but I will follow,” Kitchens said.</p>

        <p> Students at Elon University voted The Tripps as the best local band. The Tripps is a band consisting of seniors Matt Snow, Brett Cashmer, James Setzer and Eric Reeder.</p>
                <p>The Tripps believe they were voted best local band because of their unique stage presence.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say our sound is better than anyone else’s,” said lead singer and guitarist Brett Cashmer. “I think we are a lot of fun. I think we show up and play and we have fun.”</p>
<p>This is the last semester the Tripps will be producing music together. Going into his freshman year, Cashmer said, “I thought I was going to do some solo [stuff].” Now, The Tripps are successful, often playing at on-campus events and in local bars such as the Fat Frogg Bar and Grill.</p>
<p>The Tripps are all business majors. And though music is their passion, Cashmer said, “What we’ll probably have to do is business.”</p>
<p>Setzer, the bassist, believes much of why students become engaged with their music is because of the band’s unique personality and energy.</p>
<p>“We are basically heroes,” Setzer said. “We are the punk-rock Gandhis. We could probably write a textbook manifesto on music.”</p>
<p>Ellie Cook, freshman and SGA senator, heard the Tripps compete at Battle of the Bands. The persona of the band kept her connected to the music and the dancefloor. </p>
<p>“They covered well-known songs but made them their own,” Cook said. “My friends and I all loved dancing to their songs and couldn’t stop talking about their set after the show.”
