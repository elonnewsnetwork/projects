            <p>Pandora’s Pies, the Root and Tangent are the usual go-to places for Elon University students looking to venture outside of the campus dining halls, but this Valentine’s Day is the time taking chances. We traveled outside Elon’s bubble to get a “taste” of something new. </p>

            <h5>1. For the classic couple: Blue Ribbon Diner </h5>
            <p>Location: Church Street, Burlington</p> 
            <div>
            
            
            <p>Milkshake with two straws, please. The Blue Ribbon Diner is a perfect option for a classic date. No matter who your partner is, he or she is sure to find something pleasing on the menu — from the Knife n’ Fork Chuck Burger to a plate of Chicken Parmesan. Buy your partner a song on the jukebox or sample a bite of every dessert. This diner has the authentic diner feel down to a tee, and it will make your V-Day date feel as though it's straight out of the movie Grease.

<h5> 2. For your southern squeeze: Dame’s Chicken and Waffles 
</h5>
            <p> Location: Martin Luther King Jr Dr, Greensboro 
</p>
            
            <p>Did someone say southern fried chicken and crispy waffles? Dame's Chicken and Waffles is a unique dining experience for those who wish to cater to both their sweet and salty taste buds. Dame's offers meal combos and tons of sides and spreads to personalize your plate. You don’t want to miss out on the Cheesy Ceci’s Mac 'n Cheese or the Quilted Buttercup: a chicken cutlet between two sweet potato waffles with maple-pecan shmear. Bring your Valentine here for brunch or dinner for an authentic and delicious southern experience.</p>

            <h5>3. For the boyfriend on a budget: Brixx Pizza </h5>
            <p>Location: Alamance Crossing, Burlington </p> 
            
            <p>Brixx Pizza is the best option for those college couples looking to grab a bite and spare some cash for a movie or bowling afterward. Brixx, known for their wood-fired oven pizza, offers food and drink specials nearly every night of the week. Sunday-Thursday after 10 p.m. and Friday-Saturday after 11 p.m. appetizers and pies are buy-one-get-one. Dine in or pick up food to take back home and pair with a Redbox movie. Either way, you can't go wrong.</p>

            <h5>4. For the legal-drinking-age lovers: Piedmont Ale House  </h5>
            <p>Location: St. Marks Church Rd, Burlington </p>
            
            <p>Take a short 10 minute ride from campus to Piedmont Ale House, a spirited neighborhood pub with a great atmosphere and even some live music on select nights. Piedmont Ale House is a sports bar and restaurant combo with beer bucket specials and games and music options that make it a perfect first date spot to share with your special someone. Go all out with a Southwest burger and a side of their homemade potato chips or pair an appetizer with a locally-brewed beer on tap.

            <h5>5. For the sweet-tooth sweethearts: Press Coffee and Crepes
</h5>
            <p>Location: Main St, Graham 
</p>
            <p>If you and your partner aren’t night owls, Press is the place for you. Press Coffee and Crepes can please any sweet tooth with their Sweet Granny Crepe or full list of teas. If you aren’t craving something sugary, there are also savory options such as the Buffalo Chicken Crepe or the Pesto Pasta Salad. You and your sweetheart may choose to eat inside or outside, depending on the weather. Your partner will be thanking you a b(r)unch for this super cute, yet casual, date.

            <h5>6. For the big eaters: Hwy 55 Burgers Shakes and Fries 
</h5>
            <p>Location: University Drive, Burlington 
</p>
            <p>They say the way to someone's heart is through their stomach, so why not fill it up? Hwy 55 is a classic burger joint very close to Elon’s campus. It offers mouth-watering big bite burgers and cheesesteaks that won’t leave anyone hungry afterward. Impress your fellow food-lover and earn bragging rights by completing the Five Five Challenge: if you can eat a 55 oz. burger with four trimmings and fries and finish 24 oz. drink within 30 minutes, the meal will be free. Top off the experience with Hwy’s Frozen Custard (if you have room left, of course).
